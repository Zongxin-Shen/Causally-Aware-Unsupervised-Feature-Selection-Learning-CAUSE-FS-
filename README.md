Causally-Aware Unsupervised Feature Selection Learning (CAUSE-FS)
===

This repository provides the MATLAB implementation of the proposed method: Causally-Aware Unsupervised Feature Selection Learning.

All experiments were conducted using MATLAB R2022b on a desktop equipped with an Intel Core i9-10900 CPU (2.80 GHz) and 64 GB of RAM.

Datasets
-------------

In the "Datasets" folder, we provide the dataset used in the experiments, jaffe.mat. The remaining datasets can be downloaded from the sources provided in our paper.


Code of CAUSE-FS
-------------

The code of the proposed CAUSE-FS can be found in the "CAUSE-FS" folder. Some explanations regrading the code are presented below:
1.The file "CAUSE-FS" is the core part of our algorithm, which contains the details of the optimization.
2.The file "InitPar" is used to initialize parameters.
3.The file "CalcMeasure" is used to compute the performance metrics.

Demo
-------------
The file "main" provides a usage example of our algorithm.
